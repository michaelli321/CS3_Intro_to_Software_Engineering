# CS3: Intro to Software Engineering

CS 3 is a practical introduction to software engineering with an emphasis on understanding and minimizing risk in large software projects. Students will work in teams on a course-long project. Topics covered include revision control, code reviews, testing and testability, code readability, API design, refactoring, and documentation. The course provides opportunities to present your work to the class, and emphasizes working with other peopleâ€™s code, both that of classmates and pre-existing frameworks.
